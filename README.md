# BarberShopQueueSystem
I have a friend that runs a barber shop. He only accepts walk-ins. Some people complain that they don't like to arrive to the shop and see that they are 3rd, 4th, 5th in the queue. They complain because they don't want to have to wait so long for their haircut. The clients wish there was a way for them to know how busy the shop is before they arrived - this way they can plan their day around when to get a haircut. 

I would like to help my barber friend here by creating a digital queue. This queue will help organize the queue of clients. I expect the digital queue to serve as a digital "deli ticket dispenser". A deli ticket dispenser helps manage customer service in busy establishments by assigning unique numbers to each customer in line, then displaying the current number being served. Customers take a ticket, monitor the displayed number, and are called when their turn arrives. Here's a more detailed explanation:
1. Number Assignment: Customers receive a ticket with a sequential number. 
2. Display: A digital display (or sometimes a visual display with numbers) shows the current number being served. 
3. Waiting and Monitoring: Customers wait in a designated area, monitoring the display for their number to be called. 
4. Progressing the Queue: When a customer's order is completed, the number on the display is advanced to the next in line. 
5. Service: The clerk calls out the current number, and the customer with that number approaches the counter to place their order.  

I would like you to create a simple program. This program will work as like the "deli ticket dispenser" that I described before. I would like this program to be written in python. 

Eventually, I would like to scale this program in a webpage. This webpage will be accessible to all of the barber's clients.
